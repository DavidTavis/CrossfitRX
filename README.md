# CrossfitRX

This app includes few crossfit channels on Youtube, basically, with crossfit movements video tutorials. And allows easily overview content of theses channels and helps to increase a crossfit motivation.

In this app, I used the following stack of technologies: MVP designpattern, RxJava, Retrofit2, OkHttp2, ButterKnife, YouTube Data API, AdMob API, Snackbar, RecyclerView, AsyncTask.
